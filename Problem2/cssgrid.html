            <img src="pesto.png" alt="Pesto the Penguin">
            <p>Pesto, a king penguin, was hatched on January 30, 2024, at Sea 
                Life Melbourne Aquarium, weighing 200 grams at birth. While his 
                biological father is Blake, the aquarium’s largest penguin, 
                Pesto was raised by foster parents Tango and Hudson due to Blake’s
                 age and the foster pair’s previous challenges in hatching eggs.
                 By September 2024, Pesto had grown impressively, weighing 22.5 
                 kilograms and standing 90 cm tall—making him the largest king 
                 penguin chick in the aquarium’s history. His large size is 
                 attributed to genetics and attentive care, though he’s expected
                  to slim down to around 15 kilograms as an adult.
